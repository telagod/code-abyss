## The problem

Most AI coding agents have **no memory of who they are**. They respond in the same flat tone whether they're debugging a race condition, reviewing architecture, or triaging a P0 incident. They forget your conventions between sessions. They flip-flop on advice. They sound like a help-desk script.

And when you ask them about **security** — pentest, code audit, threat modeling, IR — most agents fall back to generic OWASP recitation, because the underlying skill library was never written by people who actually run red/blue/purple teams.

You don't want a help desk. You want a **principal engineer who shows up with a personality, executes consistently, closes the loop — and has a security spine when things get real**.

## What Code Abyss does

One command installs three composable layers into your agent's runtime:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Identity     who it is     →  config/personas/*.md │
│  Behavior     how it acts   →  _shared/*.md         │
│  Style        how it sounds →  output-styles/*.md   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  6 personas  ×  6 styles  =  36 validated combinations
```

Pick any persona. Pair it with any style. The behavior layer (iron laws, execution chains, proactive protocol, skill routing) stays constant. Your agent becomes a **consistent character with structured execution and domain expertise** across every session.

### What's new in v4

- **4 native security domains** — 4073 lines of original defense engineering (no Apache-2.0 upstream)
- **30 skills total**, all `SKILL.md` ≤ 110 lines (avg 59), heavy content lives in `references/`
- 5 verify skills rewritten as **judgment-type knowledge** (when to use, how to interpret output, exemption rules)
- Office skills slim to under 100 lines each; 4 design systems consolidated into one selector skill
- **v4.1 — self-evolution forge**: `cultivating-skills` / `cultivating-personas` let the agent distill repeated workflows into reusable skills, with a safety scan and a three-tier publish funnel (local → project → community)
- **v4.4 — hardware + academic writing**: 3 new domain skills (KiCad EDA, hardware product pipeline, AIGC detection reduction) + prompt injection defense + execution-drive shared behavior
- **v4.5 — dynamic persona loading**: only `abyss` ships with npm — all other personas are fetched from GitHub on first use and cached locally, slimming the package
- **v4.6 — code graph intelligence**: `abyss` CLI builds a code relationship graph (call graph + temporal analysis) in seconds — caller tracing, impact analysis, hotspot detection, change coupling. Pre-edit hooks auto-check callers across all 4 platforms
- **v4.7 — measured resolution**: `abyss` v0.3.3 ships four-language reference resolution (Go / TypeScript / Python / Rust), benchmarked against SCIP ground truth across five corpora at ≥98.5% gated precision. Named-import binding tiers, receiver-type inference, and type-grade evidence — published numbers, not claims. `npm install -g @code-abyss/cli`

```bash
npx code-abyss -t claude -y
```

Or as a Claude Code plugin:

```bash
claude plugin install code-abyss
```

## Security suite (v4 highlight)

**4 native security skills, 4073 lines of original engineering content.** No Apache-2.0 upstream — every example, every detection signal, every defense pattern is written for this project.

| Skill | Focus | Size |
|---|---|---|
| 🛡 **[defending-applications](skills/defending-applications/SKILL.md)** | Web/API/GraphQL hardening, OAuth/OIDC/JWT/Session, **LLM AppSec** (prompt injection, RAG poisoning, agent authz) | 785 lines |
| ☁️ **[securing-cloud-and-supply-chain](skills/securing-cloud-and-supply-chain/SKILL.md)** | Container escape, K8s RBAC/PSS, Service Mesh, **SLSA/Sigstore/SBOM**, cloud IAM, IaC | 1246 lines |
| 🔭 **[detecting-and-responding](skills/detecting-and-responding/SKILL.md)** | **Sigma/YARA** rule writing, EDR primitives, NIST 800-61 IR, forensics (Win/Linux/Mac/Cloud), hypothesis-driven threat hunting | 942 lines |
| 🏛 **[architecting-security](skills/architecting-security/SKILL.md)** | **STRIDE/PASTA/LINDDUN** threat modeling, zero-trust identity (WebAuthn / Kerberos hardening / PAM JIT), SOC2/PCI/HIPAA/GDPR evidence chains | 1100 lines |

Plus `securing-systems` as the router skill covering pentest, code audit, red/blue/purple team operations. Every attack technique ships with the matching detection signal and mitigation pattern — "with offense as defense" is structural, not lip service.

## Code graph intelligence (powered by `abyss`)

**Your agent can now see code relationships.** The `abyss` CLI builds a full call graph, temporal analysis, and hotspot map — in seconds, with zero cloud dependencies.

| Capability | What it answers | Command |
|---|---|---|
| **Caller tracing** | "Who calls this function?" | `abyss callers <symbol>` |
| **Impact analysis** | "What breaks if I change this?" | `abyss impact <symbol>` |
| **File context** | "What do I need to know before editing this file?" | `abyss context <file>` |
| **Hotspot map** | "Where is the riskiest code?" | `abyss map` |
| **Change coupling** | "Which files always change together?" | `abyss map` |
| **Evolution trace** | "Why does this code look the way it does?" | `abyss history <file>` |

The `indexing-code` skill automatically hooks into all 4 supported platforms — before every Edit/Write, the agent checks callers and warns about high-impact changes. Available as a CLI via the agent's shell tool, or as an `abyss mcp` server (7 tools over stdio).

**Resolution is measured, not asserted.** abyss resolves call references through tiered heuristics, each tagged with a confidence score, and benchmarks itself against SCIP (compiler-grade) ground truth across four languages and five corpora — published whatever the numbers say:

| Corpus | Language | Gated precision | Gated recall |
|--------|----------|----------------:|-------------:|
| gin v1.10.0 | Go | **99.3%** | 82.6% |
| hono v4.6.14 | TypeScript | **98.8%** | 63.8% |
| click 8.1.8 | Python | **98.7%** | 94.6% |
| ripgrep 14.1.1 | Rust | **98.5%** | 75.3% |
| abyss (dogfood) | Rust | **100.0%** | 90.9% |

```
# Real output from a 1862-file Go project (seconds to index):

$ abyss impact SetError
impact: SetError  direct=17  transitive=521  tests=469  uncovered=319  risk=10.0/10
  ⚠ high blast radius (17 direct callers)
  ⚠ deep dependency chain (521 transitive)
  ⚠ 319 call paths without test coverage
```

`abyss` is a separate Rust binary ([telagod/abyss](https://github.com/telagod/abyss)). The installer offers to fetch it (`--with-abyss`), or grab it directly:

```sh
npm install -g @code-abyss/cli   # prebuilt binary, all platforms
cargo binstall code-abyss        # or: cargo install code-abyss
```

## Skills

30 domain skills, flat structure, [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) aligned (with Code Abyss extensions). Skills load by context — the agent reads the right knowledge at the right time without being asked. Average `SKILL.md` is 59 lines; heavy content lives in `references/`.

| Domain | Coverage |
|---|---|
| 🛡 **Security** | 4 native suites above (defending / cloud / detect-respond / architect) + pentest / code-audit / red-blue-purple team |
| 🤖 **AI / Agent** | Single-agent dev (ReAct/Plan-Execute), multi-agent orchestration, RAG, prompt engineering, LLM security |
| 🏛 **Architecture** | API design, cloud-native patterns, messaging, caching, data security |
| 💻 **Development** | Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C++, Shell |
| 🚀 **DevOps** | Git workflow, testing, databases, observability, performance, FinOps |
| 🎨 **Frontend** | Unified design system selector — Glassmorphism / Liquid Glass / Neubrutalism / Claymorphism |
| 📑 **Office** | Word, PDF, PowerPoint, Excel — OOXML-level automation |
| 📡 **Infra / Mobile / Data** | Kubernetes, GitOps, IaC · iOS, Android, RN, Flutter · pipelines, streaming, quality |
| 🔩 **Hardware / Embedded** | Full-stack hardware product pipeline (ESP-IDF firmware + KiCad PCB + UniApp) · KiCad 9 MCP tool routing (17 tools, autoroute-only, DRC gate) |
| 📝 **Academic Writing** | AIGC detection reduction for 维普/知网/Turnitin — multi-layer rewriting (structure → lexicon → content injection), docx run-level editing |
| 🔬 **Code Intelligence** | Call graph, impact analysis, hotspot detection, change coupling, evolution tracing — via `abyss` CLI with cross-platform hooks |
| 🜲 **Self-evolution** | `cultivating-skills` (distill repeated workflows) + `cultivating-personas` (distill voice into Tech Persona Card) — both with safety scan + 3-tier publish funnel |

Five skills also ship as **executable verification tools** for CI:

```bash
node skills/analyzing-security/scripts/security_scanner.js .       # OWASP / injection / secrets
node skills/checking-code-quality/scripts/quality_checker.js .     # Complexity, dupes, naming
node skills/analyzing-changes/scripts/change_analyzer.js --mode staged
node skills/verifying-modules/scripts/module_scanner.js <path>
node skills/generating-docs/scripts/doc_generator.js <path>
```

npx code-abyss --uninstall claude   # Clean removal, restores user backups
```

Code Abyss tracks every installed file in `.code-abyss-backup/manifest.json`. Uninstall restores your previous configuration verbatim. **Your custom skills coexist** with Code Abyss skills — install/uninstall preserves anything you put under `~/.{target}/skills/` yourself.

### Upgrading

| From | To | Path |
|---|---|---|
| v3.x | v4.x | `npx code-abyss --uninstall <target>` → install v4 → `npm run migrate:v4 -- -t <target>` (optional cleanup) |
| v2.x | v3.x | `npx code-abyss --uninstall <target>` first, then install v3 |

## Tech Persona Card · open standard

Code Abyss introduces **[Tech Persona Card v1.0](docs/specs/tech-persona-card-v1.0.md)** — the first portable format for AI agent persona interchange. Think Character Card V2, but for engineering workflows instead of roleplay.

Each persona ships as a structured `persona-card.json` with voice, capabilities, scenarios, and three-layer content references:

```jsonc
{
  "spec": "tech-persona-card",
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "data": {
    "name": "stoic-architect",
    "voice": {
      "self": "I", "user": "colleague",
      "register": "formal", "emoji_policy": "none"
    },
    "scenarios": [{
      "name": "Architecture Review",
      "triggers": ["design", "scale"],
      "chain": ["constraints", "options", "trade-offs", "diagram"],
      "priority": "correctness > completeness > speed"
    }]
  }
}
```

**Bidirectional converters** ship out of the box:

```js
const { toCharaCardV2, toGPTInstructions, fromCharaCardV2 } =
  require('code-abyss/bin/lib/persona-converter');

const cc  = toCharaCardV2(card, { identityContent });   // → SillyTavern / Chub.ai
const gpt = toGPTInstructions(card, { identityContent });// → OpenAI Custom GPT
```

[**Specification**](docs/specs/tech-persona-card-v1.0.md) · [**JSON Schema**](docs/specs/persona-card.schema.json) · [**Reference cards**](config/personas/)
