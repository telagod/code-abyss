## The problem

Most AI coding agents have **no memory of who they are**. They respond in the same flat tone whether they're debugging a race condition, reviewing architecture, or triaging a P0 incident. They forget your conventions between sessions. They flip-flop on advice. They sound like a help-desk script.

And when you ask them about **security** — pentest, code audit, threat modeling, IR — most agents fall back to generic OWASP recitation, because the underlying skill library was never written by people who actually run red/blue/purple teams.

You don't want a help desk. You want a **principal engineer who shows up with a personality, executes consistently, closes the loop — and has a security spine when things get real**.

## What Code Abyss does

One command installs a layered runtime into your agent:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Voice      who it sounds like  →  config/personas/*.json │
│  Judgment    how it decides      →  skills/_kernel/*      │ ← lazy, router-invoked
│  Style       how it sounds       →  output-styles/*.md    │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  6 personas  ×  6 styles  =  36 validated combinations
```

Pick any persona. Pair it with any style. Underneath both sits a **discipline kernel** — 9
bundles of engineering judgment (when to push back, how to size scope, when a domain calls
for a specific tradeoff) invoked by a thin router on demand instead of baked into every
prompt. The always-on core stays small (iron laws, skill routing, a precedence anchor,
the safety floor); everything else loads lazily so adding discipline content doesn't blow
the context budget. Your agent becomes a **consistent character with structured execution,
domain expertise, and a backstop against the trained agree-reflex** — across every session.

### What's new in v4

- **4 native security domains** — 4073 lines of original defense engineering (no Apache-2.0 upstream)
- **30 skills total**, all `SKILL.md` ≤ 110 lines (avg 59), heavy content lives in `references/`
- 5 verify skills rewritten as **judgment-type knowledge** (when to use, how to interpret output, exemption rules)
- Office skills slim to under 100 lines each; 4 design systems consolidated into one selector skill
- **v4.1 — self-evolution forge**: `cultivating-skills` / `cultivating-personas` let the agent distill repeated workflows into reusable skills, with a safety scan and a three-tier publish funnel (local → project → community)
- **v4.4 — hardware + academic writing**: 3 new domain skills (KiCad EDA, hardware product pipeline, AIGC detection reduction) + prompt injection defense + execution-drive shared behavior
- **v4.5 — dynamic persona loading**: only the `abyss` persona slug (邪修红尘仙) ships with npm — all other personas are fetched from GitHub on first use and cached locally, slimming the package
- **v4.6 — `indexing-code` skill (calling convention only)**: the `indexing-code` skill ships the calling convention for the external [`abyss`](https://github.com/telagod/abyss) Rust CLI (call graph + temporal analysis). The CLI itself is a separate product with its own release cadence — install it with its own `install.sh` / `cargo binstall` / `@code-abyss/cli` npm wrapper
- **v4.7 — measured resolution (abyss CLI)**: the companion `abyss` Rust CLI ships four-language reference resolution (Go / TypeScript / Python / Rust), benchmarked against SCIP ground truth across five corpora at ≥98.5% gated precision. See its repo for numbers
- **v4.8 — dynamic capability discovery**: code-abyss reads `abyss skill-manifest` when the installed `abyss` CLI is ≥ 0.5.22 — exposed CLI commands, MCP tools, and daemon socket verbs are discovered at install time instead of hard-coded
- **v4.9 — hybrid split deprecation period (2026-06-25)**: `--with-abyss` / `--with-mcp` enter deprecation (removed v5.0). `--with-hooks` splits: claude/codex/gemini move to `abyss attach <host>` as the production main entrypoint (abyss v0.5.20+); openclaw/pi/hermes stay with code-abyss and `--with-hooks` now auto-spawns `install-hooks.sh` for those three. See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the migration guide
- **Merged to `main`, pending a version bump — mythos discipline kernel + persona-architecture v3 (eager→lazy)**: 9 engineering-judgment bundles (`doctrine`, `methods`, `character`, `loop-engineering` + domain bundles for `backend` / `frontend` / `hardware` / `ml` / `security`) vendored into `skills/_kernel/`, invoked lazily by a thin router instead of baked into every prompt — see [Discipline kernel](#discipline-kernel) below. Adds a **character Stop-hook backstop** (`--with-enforcement`, claude/codex) that forces one revision turn if a reply opens with a banned capitulation phrase, upward judgment gates on 16 exec skills, and an opt-in **persona behavioral battery** to spot-check whether an installed persona holds up under pushback. Not yet on npm.
- **Merged to `main`, pending a version bump — persona redesign (Persona Voice Card, supersedes Tech Persona Card v1.0)**: the v3 kernel merge's own precedence anchor claimed persona is confined to "residual space" (wording, tone, address) — an audit found that claim was false: `abyss`'s persona content carried a live authorization-tier policy and per-scenario priority orderings, none of it enforced as voice-only. Every persona is now a single flat `config/personas/<slug>.json` (self/user/language/register/emoji_policy/flourish only, `additionalProperties:false`) rendered through a fixed, code-owned template with mandatory re-validation on every render (falls back to a neutral voice on any failure, never renders unvalidated content) — see [Persona Voice Card](#persona-voice-card-open-standard) below. The judgment content that used to live in a persona moved to `skills/securing-systems/references/authorization-tiers.md`, where it's an ordinary security-domain skill concern instead of a side-channel through voice. Not yet on npm.

```bash
npx code-abyss -t claude -y                       # persona / skills / style layer (zero network)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/telagod/abyss/main/install.sh | bash   # then install abyss CLI
abyss attach claude                               # finally, attach the code-graph hook (idempotent)
```

Swap `-t claude` for `codex` / `gemini` / `openclaw`. For openclaw/pi/hermes (whose hook surface abyss CLI does not own), use `npx code-abyss -t openclaw --with-hooks` to spawn the bundled `install-hooks.sh`. Or as a Claude Code plugin:

```bash
claude plugin install code-abyss
```

> The persona/skills/style layer is fully decoupled from the code-graph CLI — installing code-abyss alone never touches the network beyond fetching remote persona content. `abyss attach <host>` is idempotent (re-running upgrades shape in place). Verify code-graph is live with `abyss --version`, then `abyss index` in any project.

## Discipline kernel

Voice and style change; judgment shouldn't. Underneath every persona×style combination sits
a **discipline kernel** — 9 bundles of engineering judgment, vendored in-tree (`skills/_kernel/`,
via `npm run kernel:sync`) and invoked lazily by a thin router (never baked into every
prompt, so adding discipline content doesn't blow the context budget):

| Bundle | Governs |
|---|---|
| 🏛 **doctrine** | Delegation, retry/escalate/ask-user decisions, the done-gate |
| 🔍 **methods** | Investigating, designing, planning, verifying, writing for someone else |
| 🎭 **character** | Pushback, scope sizing, bad news, resisting the trained agree-reflex |
| 🔁 **loop-engineering** | Session pacing, unit sizing, where a learning should live |
| ⚙️ **backend** | Stack/architecture tradeoffs, data discipline, production floors |
| 🎨 **frontend** | Visual design taste, concrete craft over generic defaults |
| 🔩 **hardware** | Component selection, electrical margins, firmware-for-unattended-devices |
| 🤖 **ml** | Method-selection ladder, eval-as-spec, LLM-era craft |
| 🛡 **security** | Threat modeling, the authorization gate before any offensive-flavored request |

**Two ways this becomes real, not aspirational:**

- **Enforcement**: `npx code-abyss -t claude --with-enforcement` installs a Stop-hook
  backstop (claude/codex) that forces one revision turn if a reply opens with a banned
  capitulation phrase ("you're absolutely right", "good catch", …) — prose bans alone lose
  to the trained agree-reflex; this is the deterministic fallback.
- **Measurement**: `scripts/persona-battery/` is a small, honest behavioral eval — 10
  probes (does the persona hold correctness over agreeableness? lead with bad news? refuse
  to fake a "done"?) scored by an LLM judge, never faked as a pass when unscored. See
  [CLAUDE.md's persona behavioral battery section](CLAUDE.md#persona-behavioral-battery-opt-in-eval)
  to run it (costs real API calls, not part of default CI).

Domain bundles also wire **upward** into 16 matching exec skills (pentest, architecture
design, ML pipelines, etc.) as a "judgment before execution" gate — the domain bundle
decides *whether/what/tradeoffs*, the exec skill still owns *how*.

---

## Security suite (v4 highlight)

**4 native security skills, 4073 lines of original engineering content.** No Apache-2.0 upstream — every example, every detection signal, every defense pattern is written for this project.

| Skill | Focus | Size |
|---|---|---|
| 🛡 **[defending-applications](skills/defending-applications/SKILL.md)** | Web/API/GraphQL hardening, OAuth/OIDC/JWT/Session, **LLM AppSec** (prompt injection, RAG poisoning, agent authz) | 785 lines |
| ☁️ **[securing-cloud-and-supply-chain](skills/securing-cloud-and-supply-chain/SKILL.md)** | Container escape, K8s RBAC/PSS, Service Mesh, **SLSA/Sigstore/SBOM**, cloud IAM, IaC | 1246 lines |
| 🔭 **[detecting-and-responding](skills/detecting-and-responding/SKILL.md)** | **Sigma/YARA** rule writing, EDR primitives, NIST 800-61 IR, forensics (Win/Linux/Mac/Cloud), hypothesis-driven threat hunting | 942 lines |
| 🏛 **[architecting-security](skills/architecting-security/SKILL.md)** | **STRIDE/PASTA/LINDDUN** threat modeling, zero-trust identity (WebAuthn / Kerberos hardening / PAM JIT), SOC2/PCI/HIPAA/GDPR evidence chains | 1100 lines |

Plus `securing-systems` as the router skill covering pentest, code audit, red/blue/purple team operations. Every attack technique ships with the matching detection signal and mitigation pattern — "with offense as defense" is structural, not lip service.

---

## Code graph intelligence (powered by `abyss`)

**Your agent can now see code relationships.** The `abyss` CLI builds a full call graph, temporal analysis, and hotspot map — in seconds, with zero cloud dependencies.

| Capability | What it answers | Command |
|---|---|---|
| **Caller tracing** | "Who calls this function?" | `abyss callers <symbol>` |
| **Impact analysis** | "What breaks if I change this?" | `abyss impact <symbol>` |
| **File context** | "What do I need to know before editing this file?" | `abyss context <file>` |
| **Hotspot map** | "Where is the riskiest code?" | `abyss map` |
| **Change coupling** | "Which files always change together?" | `abyss map` |
| **Evolution trace** | "Why does this code look the way it does?" | `abyss history <file>` |

The `indexing-code` skill automatically hooks into all 4 supported platforms — before every Edit/Write, the agent checks callers and warns about high-impact changes. Available as a CLI via the agent's shell tool, or as an `abyss mcp` server (7 tools over stdio).

**Resolution is measured, not asserted.** abyss resolves call references through tiered heuristics, each tagged with a confidence score, and benchmarks itself against SCIP (compiler-grade) ground truth across four languages and five corpora — published whatever the numbers say:

| Corpus | Language | Gated precision | Gated recall |
|--------|----------|----------------:|-------------:|
| gin v1.10.0 | Go | **99.3%** | 82.6% |
| hono v4.6.14 | TypeScript | **98.8%** | 63.8% |
| click 8.1.8 | Python | **98.7%** | 94.6% |
| ripgrep 14.1.1 | Rust | **98.5%** | 75.3% |
| abyss (dogfood) | Rust | **100.0%** | 90.9% |

```
# Real output from a 1862-file Go project (seconds to index):

$ abyss impact SetError
impact: SetError  direct=17  transitive=521  tests=469  uncovered=319  risk=10.0/10
  ⚠ high blast radius (17 direct callers)
  ⚠ deep dependency chain (521 transitive)
  ⚠ 319 call paths without test coverage
```

`abyss` is a separate Rust binary ([telagod/abyss](https://github.com/telagod/abyss)). The installer offers to fetch it (`--with-abyss`), or grab it directly:

```sh
npm install -g @code-abyss/cli   # prebuilt binary, all platforms
cargo binstall code-abyss        # or: cargo install code-abyss
```

---

## Skills

30 domain skills, flat structure, [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) aligned (with Code Abyss extensions). Skills load by context — the agent reads the right knowledge at the right time without being asked. Average `SKILL.md` is 59 lines; heavy content lives in `references/`. (`verify:skills` validates 39 total — these 30 domain skills plus the 9 [discipline kernel](#discipline-kernel) bundles, which are router-invoked judgment, not user-facing commands.)

| Domain | Coverage |
|---|---|
| 🛡 **Security** | 4 native suites above (defending / cloud / detect-respond / architect) + pentest / code-audit / red-blue-purple team |
| 🤖 **AI / Agent** | Single-agent dev (ReAct/Plan-Execute), multi-agent orchestration, RAG, prompt engineering, LLM security |
| 🏛 **Architecture** | API design, cloud-native patterns, messaging, caching, data security |
| 💻 **Development** | Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, C++, Shell |
| 🚀 **DevOps** | Git workflow, testing, databases, observability, performance, FinOps |
| 🎨 **Frontend** | Unified design system selector — Glassmorphism / Liquid Glass / Neubrutalism / Claymorphism |
| 📑 **Office** | Word, PDF, PowerPoint, Excel — OOXML-level automation |
| 📡 **Infra / Mobile / Data** | Kubernetes, GitOps, IaC · iOS, Android, RN, Flutter · pipelines, streaming, quality |
| 🔩 **Hardware / Embedded** | Full-stack hardware product pipeline (ESP-IDF firmware + KiCad PCB + UniApp) · KiCad 9 MCP tool routing (17 tools, autoroute-only, DRC gate) |
| 📝 **Academic Writing** | AIGC detection reduction for 维普/知网/Turnitin — multi-layer rewriting (structure → lexicon → content injection), docx run-level editing |
| 🔬 **Code Intelligence** | Call graph, impact analysis, hotspot detection, change coupling, evolution tracing — via `abyss` CLI with cross-platform hooks |
| 🜲 **Self-evolution** | `cultivating-skills` (distill repeated workflows) + `cultivating-personas` (distill voice into a Persona Voice Card) — both with safety scan + 3-tier publish funnel |

Five skills also ship as **executable verification tools** for CI:

```bash
node skills/analyzing-security/scripts/security_scanner.js .       # OWASP / injection / secrets
node skills/checking-code-quality/scripts/quality_checker.js .     # Complexity, dupes, naming
node skills/analyzing-changes/scripts/change_analyzer.js --mode staged
node skills/verifying-modules/scripts/module_scanner.js <path>
node skills/generating-docs/scripts/doc_generator.js <path>
```

npx code-abyss --list-styles        # Browse styles
npx code-abyss --uninstall claude   # Clean removal, restores user backups
```

Code Abyss tracks every installed file in `.code-abyss-backup/manifest.json`. Uninstall restores your previous configuration verbatim. **Your custom skills coexist** with Code Abyss skills — install/uninstall preserves anything you put under `~/.{target}/skills/` yourself.

### Upgrading

## Persona Voice Card · open standard

Code Abyss ships **[Persona Voice Card v1.0](docs/specs/persona-voice-card-v1.0.md)** — a
closed-vocabulary voice format, not a document. It supersedes the original Tech Persona Card
v1.0 (deprecated, frozen for link stability): that format's freeform `identity.md`/`behavior.md`
files and `scenarios[].priority`/`capabilities.authorization` fields let real judgment content
accrete into what was supposed to be a voice-only layer, with nothing checking for it. The
replacement's whole design principle: **a persona cannot carry judgment if there is no field
shaped like a decision table anywhere in its type** — not a review checklist, the schema itself.

Each persona ships as one flat file — `self`/`user`/`language`/`register`/`emoji_policy`/`flourish`
and nothing else (`additionalProperties: false`):

```jsonc
{
  "spec": "persona-voice-card",
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "slug": "stoic-architect",
  "label": "Stoic Architect",
  "self": "I", "user": "colleague",
  "language": "English, technical terms preserved",
  "register": "formal", "emoji_policy": "none",
  "flourish": ["Let's look at the constraints first"]
}
```

`register`/`emoji_policy` each select one of a handful of code-owned template sentences — the
persona picks, never writes, the sentence. Every render re-validates against the schema, no
bypass; a validation failure (hand-edit, stale cache, compromised community fork) falls back to
a neutral voice instead of ever rendering unvalidated content.

**Bidirectional converters** ship out of the box:

```js
const { toCharaCardV2, toGPTInstructions, fromCharaCardV2 } =
  require('code-abyss/bin/lib/persona-converter');

const cc  = toCharaCardV2(card);   // → SillyTavern / Chub.ai
const gpt = toGPTInstructions(card); // → OpenAI Custom GPT
```

[**Specification**](docs/specs/persona-voice-card-v1.0.md) · [**JSON Schema**](docs/specs/persona-voice-card.schema.json) · [**Reference cards**](config/personas/) · [**Deprecated v1.0 spec**](docs/specs/tech-persona-card-v1.0.md)
